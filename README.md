## Client Vision
University House and Graduate House provide single, and double, self-catered accommodation for 220 full-time graduate students of the ANU. Our resident postgraduate community is a mirror of that at ANU - from some 40 nations, and across the ANU’s seven Colleges. Around 75% of our residents are PhD scholars, and 25% Masters Scholars; and approximately 85% are international students at ANU. This diversity is one of our defining characteristics and great strengths. Our principles/ethos is reflected in our Community Values Statement. University and Graduate Houses are an inclusive and accepting residential graduate community. We value our diversity of academic pursuits, beliefs and religions, cultures and nationalities, and personal interests and identities. We treat each other with respect and consideration. An objective implicit in this statement is to build a stronger sense of community for all residents.


The Graduate House and University House community is diverse, consisting of predominantly of mature age international graduate student residents (75% PhD). Both Houses have long enjoyed a reputation for providing quiet environments in which postgraduate residents can work and live. This ‘quiet environment’ has also fostered one in which residents can become isolated. To encourage social cohesion, the management team along with the Graduate Residence Common Room Committee (GCRC) work together to facilitate a range of activities to support the academic, cultural, artistic, sporting, and social life of residents throughout the year. In addition to the GCRC planned activities, a weekly dinner is provided to all residents. The House Dinner takes place each Wednesday. Attendance averages at 50% of the community but one of the 2020 goals is to increase the attendance to 60 – 70%.

## Objectives
The Our Culture project have three phases to proceed which are research,design and construction.A successful project could be implemented at the other residences at the ANU.
- Research:We will get the recommendation from the professional practice 2(PP2) student.They conduct the initial review to determine and define resident needs and expectations.What we have to do is to attend the tutorial weekly and recommend what we want so they can create and conduct resident surveys, focus groups and feedback sessions.The goal of research is to know the demand of the resident.

- Design:With the help of the recommendation from the pp2 student,we use these things as the foundation of the updated website.We also need to review the existing uses of technology, internal websites and the booking registration systems.The test of feasibility also needs.

- Construction:Recommend to use Word Press to construct the updated website.Old functions must be retained.Redesign both the front and back end.The work should be student centred and if there is a opportunity,create a new services and enhanced functionality also recommend.

## Project Outline
Update the website of University House and graduate house  

- Goal1: Recommendations for new or improved service offerings, social media and communication strategies.

- Goal2: Recommendations for data analytics: Digital record-keeping, reach, attendance, record keeping, and student ID scanning with particular consideration of resident privacy, data security and risk management.

- Goal3: Recommend events/activities that capture the interest of a culturally and linguistically diverse cohort of residents.


## Deliverables:
- Formulate and produce content including material that can be included/incorporated in the proposed solutions

- Produce instructional guides to explain how staff and residential scholars can use/update the platforms suggested

## Milestones,Scheduling,Deliverables
- Milestones
In this semester what we need to do is to attend the pp2 tutorial weekly and recommend their research as client.We will receive the survey data and recommendation from pp2 student at the end of the semester.The project team can start to construct the prototype of the website independently from week 9.Also pp2 students will not engage in the project at semester 2.
- Scheduling
We need to align with best practice.We will attend the pp2 tutorial weekly and make improvements of the project which base on pp2 students’ survey results.
- Deliverables
1. A website with complete front and back end which is student-centred design.
2. Enhance old functions and add some new services.
3. Fit within the ANU policy framework, security and privacy guidelines. 
4. Test the website and get feedback from the users.


## Technical and other constraints
- Security improvement
- Single Sign-on
- How to link the old database to the new back end

## Resources,Risks,Intellectual Property
- Resources:
1. Project team:Design and construct the website
2. Professional Practice 2 student:Needs analysis data and recommendataions
3. Robert Freeth:The old database of the outdated website
4. [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/)
- Risks:May threaten the database integrity and accessibility.
- Intellectual Property:WordPress (WordPress.org) is a free and open-source content management system (CMS) written in PHP[4] and paired with a MySQL or MariaDB database.Buy basic services on this website can solve Intellectual Property issues well(recommended by Emmaline Lear).
